            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This proposal is part of the Digital finance package, a package of measures to further enable and support the potential of digital finance in terms of innovation and competition while mitigating the risks arising from it. It is in line with the Commission priorities to make Europe fit for the digital age and to build a future-ready economy that works for the people. The digital finance package includes a new Strategy on digital finance for the EU financial sector</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

In addition to this proposal, the package also includes a proposal for a regulation on markets in crypto assets</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref3" href="#footnote3">2</a>
               </span><span>, a proposal for a regulation on a pilot regime on distributed ledger technology (DLT) market infrastructure</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref4" href="#footnote4">3</a>
               </span><span>, and a proposal for a directive to clarify or amend certain related EU financial services rules</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="#footnote5">4</a>
               </span><span>.Digitalisation and operational resilience in the financial sector are two sides of the same coin. Digital, or Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), gives rise to opportunities as well as risks. These need to be well understood and managed, especially in times of stress. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Policymakers and supervisors have therefore increasingly focused on risks stemming from reliance on ICT. They have notably tried to enhance firms’ resilience through the setting of standards and through the coordination of regulatory or supervisory work. This work has been carried out at both international and European level, and both across industries as well as for a number of specific sectors, including financial services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>ICT risks nevertheless continue to pose a challenge to the operational resilience, performance and stability of the EU financial system. The reform that followed the 2008 financial crisis primarily strengthened the financial resilience</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="#footnote6">5</a>
               </span><span> of the EU financial sector, only addressing ICT risks indirectly in some areas, as part of the measures to address operational risks more broadly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>While the post-crisis changes to the EU financial services legislation put in place a Single Rulebook governing large parts of the financial risks associated with financial services, they did not fully address digital operational resilience. The measures taken in relation to the latter were characterised by a number of features that limited their effectiveness. For example, they were often devised as minimum harmonisation directives or principled-based regulations, leaving substantial room for diverging approaches across the Single Market. In addition, there has been only some limited or incomplete focus on ICT risks in the context of the operational risk coverage. Finally, these measures vary across the sectoral financial services legislation. Thus, the intervention at Union level did not fully match what European financial entities needed for managing operational risks in a way that withstand, respond and recover from impacts of ICT incidents. Nor did it provide financial supervisors with the most adequate tools to fulfil their mandates to prevent financial instability stemming from the materialization of those ICT risks. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The absence of detailed and comprehensive rules on digital operational resilience at EU level has led to the proliferation of national regulatory initiatives (e.g. on digital operational resilience testing) and supervisory approaches (e.g. addressing ICT third-party dependencies). Action at Member State level, however, only has a limited effect given cross-border nature of ICT risks. Moreover, the uncoordinated national initiatives have resulted in overlaps, inconsistencies, duplicative requirements, high administrative and compliance costs - especially for cross-border financial entities - or in ICT risks remaining undetected and hence unaddressed. This situation fragments the single market, undermines the stability and integrity of the EU financial sector, and jeopardises the protection of consumers and investors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>It is therefore necessary to put in place a detailed and comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for EU financial entities. This framework will deepen the digital risk management dimension of the Single Rulebook. In particular, it will enhance and streamline the financial entities’ conduct of ICT risk management, establish a thorough testing of ICT systems, increase supervisors’ awareness of cyber risks and ICT-related incidents faced by financial entities, as well as introduce powers for financial supervisors to oversee risks stemming from financial entities’ dependency on ICT third-party service providers. The proposal will create a consistent incident reporting mechanism that will help reduce administrative burdens for financial entities, and strengthen supervisory effectiveness. </span>

Current disparities in this area, both at legislative and supervisory levels, as well as national and EU levels, act as obstacles to the single market in financial services because financial entities that engage in cross-border activities face different, where not overlapping, regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations with the potential to impede the exercise of their freedoms of establishment and of provision of services. Different rules also distort competition between the same type of financial entities in different Member States. Moreover, in areas where harmonisation is absent, partial or limited, the development of divergent national rules or approaches, either already in force or in the process of adoption and implementation at national level, can act as a deterrent to the single market freedoms for financial services. This is particularly the case as regards to digital operational testing frameworks and the oversight of critical ICT third-party service providers.</span>

                  <span>This proposal harmonises the digital operational component of a deeply integrated and interconnected sector that already benefits from a single set of rules and supervision in most other key areas. For matters such as ICT-related incident reporting, only Union harmonised rules could reduce the level of administrative burdens and financial costs associated with the reporting of the same ICT-related incident to different Union and national authorities. EU action is needed to also facilitate the mutual recognition of advanced digital operational resilience testing results for entities operating cross-border, which in the absence of Union rules are or may be subject to different frameworks in different Member States. Only action at Union level can address the differences in testing approaches that Member States have introduced. EU-wide action is also needed to address the lack of appropriate oversight powers to monitor risks stemming from ICT third-party service providers, including concentration and contagion risks for the EU financial sector. </span>

                  <span>No Union financial services legislation has until now focussed on operational resilience and none has comprehensively tackled risks emerging from digitalisation, not even those whose rules address more generally the operational risk dimension with ICT risk as a sub-component. Union intervention so far have helped to address needs and problems that were present in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis: credit institutions were not sufficiently capitalised, financial markets were not sufficiently integrated, and harmonisation up until that point had been kept minimal. ICT risk was not considered a priority then, and, as a result, the legal frameworks for the different financial subsectors has evolved in an uncoordinated manner. Still, Union action has achieved its objectives of ensuring financial stability and to establish a single set of harmonised prudential and market conduct rules applicable to financial entities throughout the EU. Since factors driving Union legislative intervention in the past did not enable specific or comprehensive rules to address the widespread use of digital technologies and consequent risks in finance, carrying out an explicit evaluation appears challenging. An implicit evaluation exercise and consequent legislative amendments are reflected in each pillar of this Regulation.. </span>

               <span>In terms of budgetary implications, as the current Regulation foresees an enhanced role for the ESAs by means of powers granted upon them to adequately oversee critical ICT third-party providers, the proposal would entail the deployment of increased resources, in particular to fulfil the oversight missions (such as onsite and online inspections and audits exercises) and the use of staff possessing specific ICT security expertise. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Text1">
               <span>The scale and distribution of these costs will depend on the extent of the new oversight powers and the (precise) tasks to be performed by the ESAs. In terms of providing new staff resources, EBA, ESMA and EIOPA will require in total 18 full-time employees (FTE) - 6 FTEs for each authority - when the different provisions of the proposal will enter into application (estimated at EUR 15,71 million for the period 2022 - 2027). The ESAS will also incur additional IT costs, mission expenses for the onsite inspections and translation costs (estimated at EUR 12 million for the period 2022 - 2027), as well as other administrative expenditure (estimated at EUR 2,48 million for the period 2022 - 2027). Therefore, the estimated total cost impact is approximately EUR 30,19 million for the period 2022 - 2027.</span>

            <p class="Text1">
               <span>It should also be noted that, while the headcount (e.g. new staff members and other expenditure related to the new tasks) necessary for direct oversight will depend over time on the development of the number and size of the critical ICT third-party service providers to be overseen, the respective expenditure will be fully funded by fees raised from those market participants.

At the same time, the regulation acknowledges that significant differences exist between financial entities in terms of size, business profiles or in relation to their exposure to digital risk. Since larger financial entities have more resources, only financial entities not qualifying as microenterprises are required, for instance, to establish complex governance arrangements, dedicated management functions, perform in-depth assessments after major changes in the network and information system infrastructures, regularly conduct risk analyses on legacy ICT systems, expand the testing of business continuity and response and recovery plans to capture switchover scenarios between their primary ICT infrastructure and redundant facilities. Moreover, only financial entities identified as significant for the purposes of the advanced digital resilience testing will be required to conduct threat led penetration tests. </span>

               <span>Digital operational resilience is rooted in a set of key principles and requirements on ICT risk management framework, in line with the joint ESAs technical advice. These requirements, inspired from relevant international, national and industry-set standards, guidelines and recommendations, revolve around specific functions in ICT risk management (identification, protection and prevention, detection, response and recovery, learning and evolving and communication). To keep pace with a quickly evolving cyber threat landscape, financial entities are required to set-up and maintain resilient ICT systems and tools that minimize the impact of ICT risk, to identify on a continuous basis all sources of ICT risk, to set-up protection and prevention measures, promptly detect anomalous activities, put in place dedicated and comprehensive business continuity policies and disaster and recovery plans as an integral part of the operational business continuity policy. The latter components are required for a prompt recovery after ICT-related incidents, in particular cyber-attacks, by limiting damage and prioritising safe resumption of activities. The regulation does not itself impose specific standardization, but rather builds on European and internationally recognized technical standards or industry best practices, insofar they are fully compliant with supervisory instructions on the use and incorporation of such international standards. This regulation also covers the integrity, safety and resilience of physical infrastructures and facilities that support the use of technology and the relevant ICT-related processes and people, as part of the digital footprint of a financial entity’s operations. </span>

Second, only ICT-related incidents that are deemed major must be reported to the competent authorities. The reporting should be processed using a common template and following a harmonised procedure as developed by the ESAs. Financial entities should submit initial, intermediate and final reports and inform their users and clients where the incident has or may have an impact on their financial interests. Competent authorities should provide pertinent details of the incidents to other institutions or authorities: to the ESAs, to the ECB and to the single points of contact designated under Directive (EU) 2016/1148.</span>

This regulation allows for a proportionate application of digital operational resilience testing requirements depending on the size, business and risk profiles of financial entities: while all entities should perform a testing of ICT tools and systems, only those identified by competent authorities (based on criteria in this regulation and further developed by the ESAs) as significant and cyber mature should be required to conduct advanced testing based on TLPTs.

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The regulation is designed to ensure a sound monitoring of ICT third-party risk. This objective will be achieved first through the respect of principle-based rules applying to financial entities’ monitoring of risk arising through ICT third-party providers. Second, this regulation harmonises key elements of the service and relationship with ICT third-party providers. These elements cover minimum aspects deemed crucial to enable a complete monitoring by the financial entity of ICT third-party risk throughout the conclusion, performance, termination and post-contractual stages of their relationship. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Most notably, the contracts that govern that relationship will be required to contain a complete description of services, indication of locations where data is to be processed, full service level descriptions accompanied by quantitative and qualitative performance targets, relevant provisions on accessibility, availability, integrity, security and protection of personal data, and guarantees for access, recover and return in the case of failures of the ICT third-party service providers, notice periods and reporting obligations of the ICT third-party service providers, rights of access, inspection and audit by the financial entity or an appointed third-party, clear termination rights and dedicated exit strategies. Moreover, as some of these contractual elements can be standardized, the regulation promotes a voluntary use of standard contractual clauses which are to be developed for the use of cloud computing service by the Commission. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Finally, the regulation seeks to promote convergence on supervisory approaches to the ICT-third-party risk in the financial sector by subjecting critical ICT third-party service providers to a Union oversight framework. Through a new harmonised legislative framework, the ESA designated as lead overseer for each such critical ICT third-party service provider receives powers to ensure that technology services providers fulfilling a critical role to the functioning of the financial sector are adequately monitored on a Pan-European scale. The oversight framework envisaged by this regulation builds on the existing institutional architecture in the financial services area, whereby the Joint Committee of the ESAs ensures cross-sectoral coordination in relation to all maters on ICT risk, in accordance with its tasks on cybersecurity, supported by the relevant subcommittee (Oversight Forum) carrying out preparatory work for individual decisions and collective recommendations to CTPPs. </span>

                  <span>The financial sector extensively relies on information and communication technologies (ICT). Despite the significant progress made through national and European targeted policy and legislative initiatives, ICT risks continue to pose a challenge to the operational resilience, performance and the stability of the EU financial system. The reform that followed the 2008 financial crisis primarily strengthened the financial resilience of the EU financial sector and aimed at safeguarding EU competitiveness and stability from economic, prudential and market conduct perspectives. ICT security and overall digital operational resilience are part of operational risk, but have been less in the focus of the post-crisis regulatory agenda, and have developed only in some areas of EU financial markets policy and regulation, or only in a few Member States. This translates into the following challenges, which the proposal should address:</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The EU legal framework covering ICT risk and operational resilience across the financial sector is fragmented and not fully consistent. </span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>The lack of consistent reporting requirements of ICT-related incidents leads to supervisors having an incomplete overview of the nature, frequency, significance and impact of incidents.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Some financial entities face complex, overlapping and potentially inconsistent reporting requirements for the same ICT-related incident.</span>

                  <span>Insufficient information sharing and cooperation on cyber threat intelligence at strategical, tactical and operational level prevent individual financial entities from adequately assessing, monitoring, defending against and responding to cyber threats.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Digital operational resilience is an issue of common interest to the EU’s financial markets. Action at EU level would bring more advantages and greater value than action taken separately at national level. Without adding these operational provisions on ICT risk, the Single Rulebook would provide the tools to tackle all other types of risks at European level, but would leave out the digital operational resilience aspects or would subject them to fragmented and uncoordinated national-level initiatives. The proposal would provide legal clarity on whether and how digital operational provisions apply, especially to cross-border financial entities, and it would eliminate the need for Member States to individually improve rules, standards and expectations regarding operational resilience and cybersecurity as a response to the current limited coverage of EU rules and the general nature of the NIS Directive.</span>

                  <span>The Union intervention would significantly increase the effectiveness of the policy while also reducing complexity and easing the financial and administrative burden on all financial entities. It would harmonise an area of the economy that is so deeply interconnected and integrated and that already benefits from a single set of rules and supervision. In terms of ICT-related incident reporting, the proposal would reduce the reporting burden - and implicit costs - of the same ICT-related incident being reported to different EU and/or national authorities. It will also facilitate the mutual recognition/acceptance of the testing results of entities operating cross-border that are subject to multiple testing frameworks in different Member States.</span>

                  <span>The objective of this proposal is consistent with a number of other EU policies and ongoing initiatives, notably the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive and the European Critical Infrastructure (ECI) Directive. The proposal would maintain the benefits associated with the horizontal framework on cybersecurity by keeping the three financial sub-sectors within the scope of the NIS Directive. By remaining associated to the NIS ecosystem, financial supervisors would be able to exchange relevant information with NIS authorities and participate in the NIS Cooperation Group. The proposal would not impact the NIS Directive but rather build on it and address possible overlaps via a lex specialis exemption. The interaction between the financial services regulation and the NIS Directive would continue to be governed by a lex specialis clause, thus exempting financial entities from substantive requirements in the NIS Directive and avoiding overlaps between the two acts. In addition, the proposal is consistent with the European Critical Infrastructure (ECI) Directive, currently under revision to enhance the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure against non-cyber threats. </span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>This proposal would not have an impact on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). First, the Oversight Framework of critical ICT third-party providers will be fully funded by fees levied from these providers; second, the additional regulatory tasks related to digital operational resilience entrusted to the ESAs will be ensured by internal redeployment of existing staff.</span>
               </p>
               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>This will translate into a proposal to increase the authorised staff of the agency during the future annual budgetary procedure. The agency will continue to work towards maximising synergies and efficiency gains (inter alia via IT systems), and closely monitor the additional workload associated with this proposal, which would be reflected in the level of authorised staff requested by the agency in the annual budgetary procedure.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>First, the additional costs could be funded through ESAs’ usual financing mechanism. This would however entail a substantial increase in the EU’s contribution to ESAs’ financial resources.</span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>This option is being chosen for the costs relating to the regulatory tasks linked to this proposal. Indeed, the ESAs will be asked to redeploy existing staff in order to develop a number of technical standards. However, the additional costs related to the oversight of critical TPPs could not be met through a redeployment of resources within the ESAs which also have other tasks in addition to those envisaged under this proposal, as well as under other pieces of Union legislation. Moreover, supervisory tasks related to digital operational resilience require specific technical knowledge and expertise. As the current level of such resources at the ESAs is insufficient, additional resources are needed.</span><span> </span>

               <p class="Normal">
                  <span>Finally, according to the proposal, fees will be levied from the critical ICT- TPPs subject to the oversight. These are intended to cover all aditional resources needed by the ESAs to perform their new tasks and powers. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>By way of introduction, it should be recalled that entities subject to direct supervision by ESMA should pay fees to ESMA (one-off costs for registration and recurrent costs for ongoing supervision). This is the case for credit rating agencies (see Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 272/2012) and trade repositories (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1003/2013).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Under this legislative proposal, the ESAs will be entrusted with new tasks aimed at promoting convergence on supervisory approaches to ICT third-party risk in the financial sector by subjecting critical ICT third party service providers to a Union Oversight Framework. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Oversight Framework envisaged by this proposal builds on the existing institutional architecture in the financial services area, whereby the Joint Committee of the ESAs ensure cross-sectoral coordination in relation to all maters on ICT risk, in accordance with its tasks on cybersecurity, supported by the relevant Subcommittee (Oversight Forum) carrying out preparatory work for individual decisions and collective recommendations addressed to critical ICT third party service providers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Through this framework, the ESAs designated as Lead Overseers for each critical ICT third party service provider receive powers to ensure that technology services providers fulfilling a critical role to the functioning of the financial sector are adequately monitored on a Pan-European scale. The oversight duties are set out in the proposal and further clarified in the explanatory memorandum. They include rights</span><span>
                  <span class="tab">   </span>to request all relevant information and documentation to conduct general investigations and inspections, to address recommendations and subsequently submit reports on the actions taken or remedies implemented the address those recommendations. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In order to perform the new tasks envisaged by this proposal, additional staff specialised in ICT risk and focussing on assessing third-party dependencies shall therefore be hired by the ESAs. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Human resources needs can be estimated at 6 FTEs for each authority (5 ADs and 1 AST to support the ADs). The ESAs will also incur additional IT costs, estimated at EUR 500 000 (one-off costs) as well as EUR 50 000 per year for each of the three ESAs for maintenance costs. One important element in the fulfilment of the new tasks are the missions to perform onsite inspections and audits, which can be estimated at EUR 200 000 per year for each ESA. Translation costs for the different documents that the ESAs would receive from the critical ICT third party service providers are also included within the row on operational costs and consist of EUR 350,000 yearly.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>All the administrative costs mentioned above will be fully funded by the annual fees levied by the ESAs from the overseen critical ICT third party service providers (no impact on EU Budget).</span>
