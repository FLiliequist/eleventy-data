<h2>Protection and Prevention </h2>
<p>1.For the purposes of adequately protecting the ICT systems and with a view to organising response measures, financial entities shall continuously monitor and control the functioning of the ICT systems and tools and shall minimise the impact of such risks through the deployment of appropriate ICT security tools, policies and procedures. </p>
2.Financial entities shall design, procure and implement ICT security strategies, policies, procedures, protocols and tools that aim at, in particular, ensuring the resilience, continuity and availability of ICT systems, and maintaining high standards of security, confidentiality and integrity of data, whether at rest, in use or in transit.</p>
3.To achieve the objectives referred to in paragraph 2, financial entities shall use state-of-the-art ICT technology and processes which:</p>
(a) guarantee the security of the means of transfer of information;</p>
(b)minimise the risk of corruption or loss of data, unauthorized access and of the technical flaws that may hinder business activity;</p>
(c) prevent information leakage;</p>
(d)ensure that data is protected from poor administration or processing-related risks, including inadequate record-keeping. </p>
4.As part of the ICT risk management framework referred to in Article 5(1), financial entities shall: </p>
(a)develop and document an information security policy defining rules to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of theirs, and their customers’ ICT resources, data and information assets; </p>
(b)following a risk-based approach, establish a sound network and infrastructure management using appropriate techniques, methods and protocols including implementing automated mechanisms to isolate affected information assets in case of cyber-attacks;</p>
(c)implement policies that limit the physical and virtual access to ICT system resources and data to what is required only for legitimate and approved functions and activities, and establish to that effect a set of policies, procedures and controls that address access privileges and a sound administration thereof; </p>
(d)implement policies and protocols for strong authentication mechanisms, based on relevant standards and dedicated controls systems to prevent access to cryptographic keys whereby data is encrypted based on results of approved data classification and risk assessment processes;</p>
(e)implement policies, procedures and controls for ICT change management, including changes to software, hardware, firmware components, system or security changes, that are based on a risk-assessment approach and as an integral part of the financial entity’s overall change management process, in order to ensure that all changes to ICT systems are recorded, tested, assessed, approved, implemented and verified in a controlled manner; </p>
(f)have appropriate and comprehensive policies for patches and updates. </p>
For the purposes of point (b), financial entities shall design the network connection infrastructure in a way that allows it to be instantaneously severed and shall ensure its compartmentalisation and segmentation, in order to minimise and prevent contagion, especially for interconnected financial processes.</p>
For the purposes of point (e), the ICT change management process shall be approved by appropriate lines of management and shall have specific protocols enabled for emergency changes. </p>
