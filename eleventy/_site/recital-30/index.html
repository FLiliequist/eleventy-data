Information sharing contributes to increased awareness on cyber threats, which, in turn, enhances financial entitiesâ€™ capacity to prevent threats from materialising into real incidents and enables financial entities to better contain the effects of ICT-related incidents and recover more efficiently. In the absence of guidance at Union level, several factors seem to have </span><span>inhibited such intelligence sharing, notably uncertainty over the compatibility with the data protection, anti-trust and liability rules. </span>
