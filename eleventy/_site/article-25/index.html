3.As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities shall adopt and regularly review a strategy on ICT third-party risk, taking into account  the multi-vendor strategy referred to in point (g) of Article 5(9).

For contractual arrangements that entail a high level of technological complexity, the financial entity shall verify that auditors, whether internal, pools of auditors or external auditors possess appropriate skills and knowledge to effectively perform relevant audits and assessments.</p>

(d)circumstances where the competent authority can no longer effectively supervise the financial entity as a result of the respective contractual arrangement. </p>
9.Financial entities shall put in place exit strategies in order to take into account risks that may emerge at the level of ICT third-party service provider, in particular a possible failure of the latter, a deterioration of the quality of the functions provided, any business disruption due to inappropriate or failed provision of services or material risk arising in relation to the appropriate and continuous deployment of the function. </p>
Financial entities shall ensure that they are able to exit contractual arrangements without: </p>
(a)disruption to their business activities, </p>
(b)limiting compliance with regulatory requirements,</p>
(c)detriment to the continuity and quality of their provision of services to clients. </p>
Exit plans shall be comprehensive, documented and, where appropriate, sufficiently tested. </p>

Financial entities shall take appropriate contingency measures to maintain business continuity under all of the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph. </p>
