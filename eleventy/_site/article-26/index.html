<h2>Preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk and further sub-outsourcing arrangements </h2>
<p>1.When performing the identification and assessment of ICT concentration risk referred to in point (c) of Article 25(5), financial entities shall take into account whether the conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to the ICT services would lead to any of the following: </p>
(a)contracting with an ICT third-party service provider which is not easily substitutable; or</p>
(b)having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services with the same ICT third-party service provider or with closely connected ICT third-party service providers. </p>
Financial entities shall weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, such as the use of different ICT third-party service providers, taking into account if and how envisaged solutions match the business needs and objectives set out in their digital resilience strategy. </p>
2.Where the contractual arrangement on the use of ICT services includes the possibility that an ICT third-party service provider further sub-contracts a critical or important function to other ICT third-party service providers, financial entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in connection with such possible sub-contracting, in particular in the case of an ICT sub-contractor established in a third-country. </p>
Where contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services are concluded with an ICT third-party service provider established in a third-country, financial entities shall consider relevant, at least the following factors:</p>
(a)the respect of data protection;</p>
(b)the effective  enforcement of the law; </p>
(c)insolvency law provisions that would apply in the event of the ICT-third party service provider’s bankruptcy;</p>
(d)any constraints that may arise in respect to the urgent recovery of the financial entity’s data. </p>
Financial entities shall assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of sub-contracting may impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively supervise the financial entity in that respect.</p>
